# py_linechart
Line chart generator on Python
You should install matplotlib before.

When started:
First question is how many lines do you need.
Second - how many points X-axis should have.
Quantity of X-axis points will be equal to Y-axis points.
Than you will type values for X-axis.
After that - values for Y-axis.
If you chose 2 or more lines, first you will type Y-axis values for first line, than values for second and so on.
X-axis values you will type only one time.
